Unfortunately,&nbsp;people&nbsp;can’t always see what’s right in front of them – and this is even true for the biggest stars in the world. Over the years, there have been countless celebrity pairs who definitely looked like they should have taken each other out of the friend zone and made steps towards a relationship. With all of the celebrity couples getting together and breaking up, it’s clear that some of these people are looking for love in all the wrong places. &nbsp;And maybe that’s because the right person is closer than they’ve ever realized. Here are 10 celebrities we wish would just get together already!</p><p><strong>Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/73280337.jpg alt="Child Magazine Fall 2007 - Backstage" width=641 height=487 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>These two young stars have known each other for nearly a decade. After starring together in the 2007 film, Bridge to Terebirthia,&nbsp;both Josh Hutcherson and AnnasSophia Robb have gone on to have pretty successful careers. There’s no doubt that this pair would definitely look great together, and in the entertainment industry, it’s always nice to be with someone you’ve known for a while.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Mat Szwajkos/Getty Images for Child Magazine)</p><p><strong>Emma Watson and Prince Harry</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/481757769.jpg alt width=640 height=430 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Earlier this year, rumors began circulating that Emma Watson and Prince Harry were an item. Although she indirectly denied the rumors, once the bug had been planted in the public’s ears, people couldn’t help but think about what a cute couple they would be. Plus, it would be a pretty cool love story to see a star from one of the most successful film franchises ever end up with a real life prince.</p><p>(Photo by Anthony Harvey/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Justin Bieber and Miley Cyrus</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/454117850.jpg alt width=641 height=463 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Over the last several years, Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber have both had their fair share of negative media attention. Both often painted as out of control teens turned young adults, they’ve been grouped together a lot of the time, and as a result, there’s been plenty of rumors about the two of them dating. Although they’ve never been an item, they would definitely make a very interesting couple. Plus, it doesn’t seem like anyone else can handle either one of them, so maybe they’re exactly what the other needs.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/117112831.jpg alt="2011 MTV Movie Awards - Show" width=641 height=515 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling will officially be working together for the third time on the upcoming film La La Land, and fans couldn’t be any more excited. Over the years, these two have displayed some pretty incredible on-screen chemistry, and viewers can’t help but wonder what their real life chemistry would be like. Although both stars are currently in long-term relationships, you never know what could happen in Hollywood.</p><p>(Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeren</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/186597754.jpg alt="Taylor Swift" width=639 height=564 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>These two superstar buddies seem to really enjoy spending time together, and have publicly&nbsp;stated that they’re just friends. Sheeren has even said that he has no intentions of hooking up with Swift, and thinks it’s healthy to have some platonic friendships. However, that hasn’t stopped fans from wishing they would just give a real relationship a shot. After having so many high-profile relationships, Taylor could definitely benefit from being with a [seemingly] nice guy like Sheeren.</p><p>(Photo by Anna Webber/Getty Images for Atlantic Records)</p><p><strong>Nicki Minaj and Drake</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/150299206.jpg alt width=640 height=516 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Since they’ve both risen to fame, there have been countless rumors about Young Money label mates, Drake and Nicki Minaj, dating. Even several of their song lyrics have suggested a romantic relationship between the two although there are no official reports of them ever being an item. Recently, Nicki’s current boyfriend, Meek Mill, started an Internet feud with Drake that many believe was sparked by his disapproval of Drake’s interest in Nicki.</p><p>(Photo by Larry Busacca/Getty Images for Pepsi)</p><p><strong>Amandla Stenberg and Jaden Smith</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/477366834.jpg alt="Women In Film 2015 Crystal + Lucy Awards Presented By Max Mara, BMW Of North America And Tiffany & Co - Red Carpet" width=640 height=435 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Amandla Stenberg and Jaden Smith have the potential to be one of the cutest and most interesting young celebrity couples on the scene. The two have already attended prom together, and they seem to have a pretty close friendship. In fact, a few months ago when Amandla called out Kylie Jenner for wearing corn rows, Kylie responded that Amandla should “go hand with J or something.”</p><p>(Photo by Mark Davis/Getty Images for Women in Film)</p><p><strong>Ashley Benson and Tyler Blackburn</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/480978232.jpg alt="MTV Fandom Awards San Diego - Show" width=639 height=452 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Thanks to the popular TV series, Pretty Little Liars, Ashley Benson and Tyler Blackburn are one of the hottest on-screen couples. Over the last several seasons of the show, their TV relationship has really blossomed and fans everywhere wish the two would just hurry up and make it official in real life. Although they’ve both stated that they’re just friends, their biggest fans continue to hold out hope that one day #Tyley will be an item.</p><p>(Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck&nbsp;</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2269147.jpg alt="75th Annual Academy Awards - Arrivals" width=640 height=508 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Now that both Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez are back on the market, it seems only right that they get back together. During the early 2000s, they were one of the hottest celebrity couples in the industry, and they were even briefly engaged. Although life took them down separate paths, now things could finally be in place for them to see what could have been.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/188004508.jpg alt="'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' Premiere - The 8th Rome Film Festival" width=641 height=427 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Hunger Games stars, Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson, have great on-screen chemistry. In the films, the two have a pretty complicated love story which has made viewers want to see them together even more. In fact, fans are wishing these two would get together on-screen and in real life. Plus, there’s nothing fans love more than when two co-stars decide to become an item in real life.</p><p>(Photo by Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images)</p><p>Lead&nbsp;(Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwMieqmavmai1brbUrKtmn5WperW7xp6roZ2iYq6tvsSam7Jn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcelebrities-wish-just-get-together-already.html&text=Celebrities%20We%20Wish%20Would%20Just%20Get%20Together%20Already%21&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcelebrities-wish-just-get-together-already.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcelebrities-wish-just-get-together-already.html&title=Celebrities%20We%20Wish%20Would%20Just%20Get%20Together%20Already%21" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcelebrities-wish-just-get-together-already.html&title=Celebrities%20We%20Wish%20Would%20Just%20Get%20Together%20Already%21" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcelebrities-wish-just-get-together-already.html&title=Celebrities%20We%20Wish%20Would%20Just%20Get%20Together%20Already%21" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcelebrities-wish-just-get-together-already.html&description=Celebrities%20We%20Wish%20Would%20Just%20Get%20Together%20Already%21" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./10037444-stephen-currys-warriors-took-a-page-out-of-tim-duncans-spurs-dynasty.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Stephen Curry's Warriors Took a Page Out of Tim Duncan's Spurs Dynasty | News, Scores, Highlights, S">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./whip-my-willow-smith-song-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Whip My ___ (Willow Smith song)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
