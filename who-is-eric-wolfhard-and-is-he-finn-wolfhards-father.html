He has also made other appearances in movies and TV shows, and this has led to the attention his family is getting today. Eric Wolfhard would have been an ordinary Canadian dad without his son’s foray into the entertainment industry.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Eric Wolfhard’s Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full name:</strong> Eric Wolfhard</li><li><strong>Gender: </strong>male</li><li><strong>Date of birth: </strong>September 14, 1965</li><li><strong>Eric Wolfhard’s Age:</strong> 58 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Caucasian</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> Canadian</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Virgo</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Married</li><li><strong>Eric Wolfhard’s Wife:</strong> Marry Jolivet Wolfhard</li><li><strong>Eric Wolfhard’s Children:</strong> Nick Wolfhard, Finn Wolfhard</li><li><strong>Eric Wolfhard’s Parents:</strong> Michael Richard Wolfhard and Nora Wolfhard</li></ul><h2><strong>Finn Wolfhard’s Father, Eric Wolfhard, Was Born in Vancouver, Canada</strong></h2><p>Eric Wolfhard was born on September 14, 1965, in Vancouver, Canada, where his parents, Michael Richard Wolfhard and Nora Wolfhard, also raised him. There is no information on any sibling he may have shared his childhood with.</p><p>Eric Wolfhard attended an undisclosed high school at his place of birth and performed well in his academics. After high school, he enrolled in college at The University of British Columbia and studied Political Science and Government. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1987</p><p>Eric Wolfhard is highly educated and versatile in his academic pursuits. He got a second degree after attending the University of Toronto Faculty of Law. Subsequently, he graduated with a Bachelor of Law degree in 1988. He later attended Harvard Law School, completing a degree course in Copyright Law before going on to build his career life.</p><h2><strong>Finn Wolfhard’s Parents?</strong></h2><p>Eric Wolfhard’s parents are Mary Jolivet Wolfhard.&nbsp;They have been married for over two decades. Not much is known about how they met and when they actually got married. However, Mary reportedly worked as Eric’s assistant in the early 1990s. They didn’t date immediately but waited until the mid-1990s. Eric and May got married sometime before the end of the 1990s.</p><p>Like Eric, Mary Jolivet is a Canadian national born in Vancouver. Her father is a French man named Lawrence Charles, and her mother is a German-Irish woman named Trish Charles. She grew up with a sister named Rita Jolivet, who is a silent actress.</p><p>Mary Wolfhard studied Visual Display and Design at Langara College and later earned a degree in French Culture from the Institut Catholique de Paris.</p><h2><strong>Finn Wolfhard is&nbsp;</strong><strong>Eric Wolfhard’s Second Son</strong></h2><p>Finn Wolfhard is the second son of Eric Wolfhard and his wife Mary Jolivet Wolfhard. He was born on December 23, 2002, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Through his birth family, Finn inherited French, German, and Jewish ancestry.</p><p>Finn Wolfhard is a celebrated Canadian known for his role in Stranger Things since 2016. However, his debut as a professional actor can be traced to 2014, when he appeared as Zoran in the second season of The 100. He has recorded many acting projects since then, including It (2017), It: Chapter Two (2019), The Goldfinch (2019), Supernatural (2015), The Adams Family (2019), and Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021).</p><p>Beyond acting, Finn is also a budding director and has made his directorial debut with the comedy short film Night Shifts (2020). He is also a singer who worked with the rock band known as Calpurnia as the lead vocalist. He is currently one of the members of another band known as The Aubreys.</p><h2><strong>Eric Also Has Another Son Named Nick</strong></h2><p>While Finn appears to be the most famous in the family, he is not the only child of Eric Wolfhard. Eric’s first child is Nick Wolfhard, who was born on October 21, 1997.</p><p>Nick is a voice actor with projects like Aftermath, Smiling Friends, The InBetween, Beyblade Burst, World Trigger, My Little Pony, and Under Wraps under his belt. He is a huge fan of anime and always knew he wanted to depict a cartoon character since he was four years old. For his competence, he received his first Leo Award nomination (best voice performance animation program or series) for his lead role in the Netflix animated TV series, “The Last Kids on Earth.”</p><h2><strong>Does Eric Wolfhard Have a Good Relationship with his Son, Finn?</strong></h2><p>Eric raised his two sons, including Finn, from childhood, and they have grown to love and respect him. If social media activities and public appearances are anything to go by, Eric Wolfhard and his son, Finn, are definitely enjoying a good relationship.</p><p>In fact, it appears Eric may have influenced his son’s choice of a career in the entertainment industry. Both father and son have creative bones and have also worked together on a project. The aforementioned 2020 short film, Night Shitfs, was produced by Eric and directed/written by his son, Finn. This is just the beginning of their collaboration, and it won’t come as a surprise if the father-and-son duo comes up with more in the future.</p><h2><strong>What Does Eric </strong><strong>Wolfhard </strong><strong>do for a Living?</strong></h2><p>Eric Wolfhard is a lawyer, researcher, and consultant. The Harvard Law School alum was called to the bar in 1992 but has focused his energy on other career fields. He is mainly a researcher but does occasional scriptwriting.</p><p>After his first degree, Wolfhard began working as a researcher for an organization recognized as FPIC City. The job saw him research indigenous land and boundary issues in Canada and Africa, as well as Aboriginal land issues. Wolfhard took part in compensations for the use of illegal land and resources belonging to indigenous people. He was also involved in the administration of indigenous assets.</p><p>In addition to working as a researcher for FPIC City, Eric Wolfhard is available as an independent consulting analyst on Aboriginal Land and Treaty Issues. With experience in handling research for Aboriginal land claims, including the Tsawwassen Reserve land transactions and other claims in Yukon, Ontario, and Manitoba, among other areas, Wolfhard is also a recognized archival research consultant.</p><p>In 2013, Eric Wolfhard teamed up with other historical researchers like Neil Vallance and Lorraine Littlefield to co-found the VLW Research, an organization that offers research and analysis of aboriginal land and treaty rights, environmental impact, and land claims.</p><p>In addition to his job as a researcher, Eric Wolfhard has also flexed his creative muscle. He has occasionally dabbled into scriptwriting with script plays such as Saint of Hearts, Black Farm, and Gentlemen of the Spade under his belt. Wolfhard also produced his son’s 2020 short film titled Night Shifts, which was written and directed by Finn Wolfhard.</p><h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><h3><strong>Who is Finn Wolfhard’s Mom?</strong></h3><p>Finn Wolfhard’s mom is Mary Jolivet, a Canadian national born in Vancouver.
