It was her proud papa that took to Twitter to let the world know about her arrival, albeit not immediately. Violet’s parents waited two weeks before the announcement which triggered lots of congratulatory messages from fans and well-wishers. .</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>What better way to celebrate the 4th… than to announce our 4th family member!!! 2 weeks ago we met our beautiful daughter Violet <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">#Happy4th</a></p><p>— John Krasinski (@johnkrasinski) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">July 4, 2016</a></p><p>Violet’s was born in Brooklyn, New York, which makes her a citizen of America, however, she comes from a mixed ethnic background. While her mum has English, Welsh, and distant Scottish backgrounds, her dad is of Irish and Polish roots.</p><p>Her parents once revealed that Violet is passing through the proper school system with proper uniforms but the name of her academic institution is not known.</p><h3><strong>Her Mother is an Actress</strong></h3><p>Violet Krasinki’s mum is a woman that goes by the full name Emily Olivia Leah Blunt. Called Emily Blunt for short, she earns a living in the movie industry as an actress. Emily became a movie star in 2001 and has been in the industry ever since.</p><p>Born in London on the 23rd of February 1983, Emily comes from a humble background, her father, Simon Peter Blunt ,worked as a legal practitioner and her mother, Joanna, was once an actress but later settled into the life of a classroom teacher.

She has numerous prestigious awards and nominations to show for her years of hard work in the movies.</p><h3><strong>Violet Krasinski’s Dad is Also a Big Name in the Entertainment Industry</strong></h3><p>Just like her mum, Violet’s dad, John Krasinski, is also into entertainment. Born on the 20th of October 1979, he is the youngest child of Mary Clare and her husband, Ronald Krasinski.</p><p>An alum of Brown University, Violet Krasinski’s father studied theatre arts during his days at the National Theatre Institute. He later moved to New York to launch a career in acting and recorded his breakthrough on the set of the TV series known as The Office.</p><p>Before his big break, John was very active in TV commercials and was participating in readings on several off-Broadway plays. There was even a time he had to work as a waiter just to make ends meet.</p><p>Apart from the NBC sitcom, The Office, John has also appeared in other productions such as Wed, Away We Go, Leatherheads, It’s Complicated, 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi, Promised Land, and more. He equally works behind the scene as a producer, screenwriter, and director.</p><p>John has received several awards and has been nominated for quite a good number.</p><h3><strong>Violet Krasinski’s Parents Had Her Six Years after Marriage</strong></h3><p>John Krasinski and his wife, Emily Blunt, were already married for six long years before welcoming their second daughter, Violet.</p><p>The celebrity couple met for the first time in 2008 courtesy of a mutual friend who introduced them. John met Emily and the said friend having a meal at a restaurant and one thing led to another, and according to Violet Krasinski’s dad, it was love at first sight for him.</p><p>By November of 2008, they went on their first date and in August 2009, John was already on bended knee asking for Emily’s hand in marriage. The actor’s marriage proposal reduced the two of them to tears and the moment got so emotional that other people in the restaurant joined in shedding tears of joy.</p><p>The celebrity duo eventually said “Yes I do” in July 2010 and their wedding ceremony was hosted in Lake Como, Italy, at a mansion belonging to entertainment giant, George Clooney.</p><h3><strong>Violet Krasinski has One Big Sister</strong></h3><p>Before Violet Krasinski was born, Emily and John were already first-time parents to Hazel Krasinski. Hazel was born two years earlier on February 16th, 2014, and John took to Twitter to announce her birth.</p><p>The proud parents had a baby shower in December in anticipation of Hazel’s birth and prior to that, they announced the pregnancy sometime in September 2013. Three months after her birth, John unveiled his first daughter’s face on Twitter saying children’s pictures ought to come from their parents alone.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Pics of kids should only come direct from parents. So I'm thrilled to introduce you guys to Hazel!!! <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">#NoKidsPolicy</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/qVvUTRdllP</a></p><p>— John Krasinski (@johnkrasinski) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">May 13, 2014</a></p><h2><strong>Violet Krasinski Has an Ear for Music</strong></h2><p>John and Emily have revealed that they would not like their children to follow the same career path as them. However, John once mentioned on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that Violet already has an ear for music.</p><p>He said a then-18-month-old Violet replied to him with a “Yeah, baby” while he was singing her a children’s song. There is also a recording where little Violet was spotted singing jingle bells.</p><h2><strong>Violet Krasinski Shares a Great Bond with Her parents</strong></h2><p>Though John and Emily try their utmost best to keep their children as far away from the limelight as possible, it is glaring that they love their daughters to distraction.</p><p>John is always talking about Violet and her big sister whenever he makes public appearances. The Office alum was on the set of Saturday Night Live as the host when he sent his girls a heartwarming shout-out wearing a black crew neck sweater sporting “H + V” for Hazel and Violet.</p><p>On her own part, Emily has said she wants her daughters to have a normal life and not feel special because of who their parents are. According to the Devil Wears Prada alum, her home is a zoo right now but she has learned to take each day as they come. Emily is just besotted with her girls and has been severally spotted with them out and about town.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMOqu8ueq2ajopbAqrrSpKBmmpmktLOtz6GwZpmemXqxsdGspqeZnGK5qrLEZqafZZWitq3FjJujrqakqHq0scKopZ1lk522rbCO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fviolet-krasinski-biography-and-personal-life-of-emily-blunts-second-child.html&text=Violet%20Krasinski%20Biography%20and%20Personal%20Life%20of%20Emily%20Blunt%27s%20Second%20Child&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fviolet-krasinski-biography-and-personal-life-of-emily-blunts-second-child.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fviolet-krasinski-biography-and-personal-life-of-emily-blunts-second-child.html&title=Violet%20Krasinski%20Biography%20and%20Personal%20Life%20of%20Emily%20Blunt%27s%20Second%20Child" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fviolet-krasinski-biography-and-personal-life-of-emily-blunts-second-child.html&title=Violet%20Krasinski%20Biography%20and%20Personal%20Life%20of%20Emily%20Blunt%27s%20Second%20Child" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fviolet-krasinski-biography-and-personal-life-of-emily-blunts-second-child.html&title=Violet%20Krasinski%20Biography%20and%20Personal%20Life%20of%20Emily%20Blunt%27s%20Second%20Child" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fviolet-krasinski-biography-and-personal-life-of-emily-blunts-second-child.html&description=Violet%20Krasinski%20Biography%20and%20Personal%20Life%20of%20Emily%20Blunt%27s%20Second%20Child" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./reddit-explains-barbie-ferreira-racist-comments.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Reddit Explains Barbie Ferreira Racist Comments: What Did She Say On Twitter?
